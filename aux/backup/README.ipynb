    "* Define a data_transform and apply it whenever you instantiate a DataLoader. The composed transform should include: rescaling/cropping, normalization, and turning input images into torch Tensors. The transform should turn any input image into a normalized, square, grayscale image and then a Tensor for your model to take it as input.\n",

    "* After visualizing a feature map, answer: what do you think it detects? This answer should be informed by how a filtered image (from the criteria above) looks.\n"
